# Processes and Signals

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This repo is all about understanding Linux processes and signals. We've got some cool Bash scripts that help you dive into the world of PIDs, processes, and signals.

## Learning Objectives

After playing around with these scripts, you'll be able to:

- Get what a PID (Process ID) is all about.
- Understand what a process is in Linux.
- Find a process' PID like a pro.
- Master the art of killing processes.
- Decode the secret language of signals.
- Identify the two signals that just can't be ignored.

## Quick Setup

1. **Clone this repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fati-Zid/alx-system_engineering-devops.git
   cd alx-system_engineering-devops/0x05-processes_and_signals

2. **Check out the scripts in action!**
   - Just make sure to run `chmod +x` on the scripts before diving in.

## Project Highlights

### 0. What is my PID
Run a script that tells you its own PID. Easy peasy!

```bash
./0-what-is-my-pid
```

### 1. List your processes
Get a neat list of all currently running processes. It's like peeking behind the scenes!

```bash
./1-list_your_processes | head -50
```

### 2. Show your Bash PID
This script spills the beans on your Bash process PID. No secrets here!

```bash
./2-show_your_bash_pid
```

### 3. Show your Bash PID made easy
Find those pesky Bash processes and their PIDs without using `ps`. You're basically a detective now!

```bash
./3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy
```

### 4. To infinity and beyond
Ever wanted to go to infinity and beyond? This script does it! But don't worry, you can stop it anytime.

```bash
./4-to_infinity_and_beyond
```

### 5. Don't stop me now!
Discover a cool way to stop the infinite journey. Spoiler: It involves using `kill`.

```bash
./5-dont_stop_me_now
```

### 6. Stop me if you can
Challenge accepted! Stop the infinity script without using `kill` or `killall`. It's like magic!

```bash
./6-stop_me_if_you_can
```

### 7. Highlander
Feel invincible while the script says "To infinity and beyond" until it hears a special signal. Spoiler: You're invincible!

```bash
./7-highlander
```

### 67. Stop me if you can
It's like a sequel to the previous script. This one stops the Highlander process.

```bash
./67-stop_me_if_you_can
```

### 8. Beheaded process
Wrap it up by killing the Highlander process. Off with its head!

```bash
./8-beheaded_process
```

Don't forget! Plagiarism is a big no-no. This is for your learning journey, not for copying and pasting.

So, grab your terminal and have some fun exploring processes and signals! ðŸš€
